# Welcome

## This Golang-based Slackbot was made to parse and return the newest articles published to Arxiv in an attempt to facilitate easier tracking of Arxiv publishes.

---

# Installation:

Installation is recommended by cloning the repo and running the program yourself.
You may also use "go get", but this functionality may not be entirely operational until later.

---

# TODO
1. ~~Create and Initialize Repo~~
2. ~~Create initial bot protocol - connecting/receiving information, connecting to a slack server~~
3. Add functionality to run your own searches and receive results. Initial functionality complete - returning 10 papers in a given query. 
4. Package and publish code

If you have any questions, please ask.

Thank you.
